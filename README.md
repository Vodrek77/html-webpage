# html-webpage
A webpage in HTML that I made for a project in my CS1 class. I used what I learned to incorporate images, links, and of course text to the webpage.

This project is a webpage made from HTML code that teaches people basic shapes (square, circle, triangle). This webpage lists info about all these shapes as well as showing a picture of them. This webpage also has Further Learning and Contact Me sections.

This project helped me learn more about HTML as well as allowing me to apply my knowledge of it to coding. This project can help children learn their basic shapes and provides visual and textual aids for these shapes. Throughout this project, I learned new things about HTML and its capabilities.
